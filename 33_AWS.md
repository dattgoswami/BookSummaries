# AWS Fundamentals Cheat Sheet

## Key Takeaways and Summary for Software Engineers

### **1. Account Creation & Security**
- For account creation, an email address, phone number, and a credit/debit card (for validation only) are required.
- Use AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) for account protection.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for increased security.
- Use AWS IAM users for daily tasks, not root user credentials.

### **2. AWS Core Services**
- **Compute**: Use EC2 for virtual machines, ECS and Fargate for managing and orchestrating containers, and Lambda for running code without managing servers.
- **Database & Storage**: RDS for managed SQL databases, DynamoDB for scalable applications, and S3 for object storage.
- **Messaging**: Use SQS for message queues, SNS for pub/sub systems, and EventBridge for an event-driven architecture.
- **Networking**: Use API Gateway to expose applications' endpoints, Route 53 for high availability, VPC for resource isolation, and CloudFront for content distribution.

### **3. AWS Cost Management**
- Understand the AWS Free Tier and Pricing Calculators.
- Use AWS Budgets and Cost Explorer for cost tracking.
- Implement cost allocation tags and restrict IAM permissions to prevent accidental costly operations.

### **4. AWS Shared Responsibility Model**
- AWS is responsible for security "of" the cloud (infrastructure).
- Users are responsible for security "in" the cloud (configuration of AWS services).

### **5. AWS IAM and Policies**
- Use IAM users, groups, and roles to manage access to AWS resources.
- Understand and implement policies (identity-based, resource-based, managed policies, and inline policies).

## More in-depth key takeaways:

### Lambda
1. Creating a Node.js function can be done directly in the AWS console.
2. Dependencies can be externalized into a Lambda layer for optimized deployment.
3. A Lambda function can invoke another function given the correct permissions.
4. Lambda functions can be exposed to the internet via API Gateway or Function URLs.
5. EFS provides durable storage, but requires the function to be attached to a VPC.
6. Use Lambda@Edge to run code closer to clients.
7. Lambda cost depends on memory settings, execution times, and ephemeral storage.

### Lambda Best Practices
1. Keep functions stateless and idempotent.
2. Monitor key metrics with CloudWatch Alarms.
3. Choose a compatible database solution, such as DynamoDB.
4. Use Step Functions for complex workflows and Lambda Layers for shared dependencies.
5. Environment variables help keep function code independent of the environment.
6. Build event-driven, resilient architectures and use structured logging.
7. Minimize cold start times by optimizing external dependencies, using warm-up requests, bootstrapping code outside the handler, and optimizing memory allocation.

### Databases & Storage
1. Amazon RDS is a fully-managed SQL database service.
2. Amazon S3 provides durable storage for unstructured data.
3. Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database optimized for low-latency, high-throughput access.
4. Managed AWS services help focus on application development and offer features like encryption and backups for data security and protection.

### Amazon RDS and DynamoDB
1. AWS data centers are divided into regions and availability zones for optimized performance and resilience.
2. Multi-AZ databases in RDS increase resilience by automatic replication.
3. Read Replicas increase performance for read-heavy workloads.
4. RDS supports automated backups and AES-256 encryption.
5. RDS pricing is based on instance class, number of nodes, pricing mode, storage, and backups.

### DynamoDB
1. Key concepts: Primary Key, Composite Keys, Scalar Types, Document Types, Set Types.
2. Operations include creating a table, scan, query, and batch operations.
3. DynamoDB doesn't enforce a schema, allows for many empty fields, and cannot do Joins across tables.
4. Marshalers return the "normal" JSON object from the DynamoDB JSON.

### DynamoDB Advanced
1. DynamoDB assigns data to partitions based on the partition key for scalability.
2. Global Secondary Indexes define a new primary key; Local Secondary Indexes add sort keys.
3. Expression Attributes prevent the use of reserved variables.
4. DynamoDB supports inserting, removing, and updating items.
5. On-Demand capacity is best for unknown traffic patterns; Provisioned capacity is cheaper for predictable traffic.

### Amazon S3
1. S3 provides object storage with any amount of data.
2. S3 Lifecycle Policies manage objects within a bucket based on their age.
3. Bucket Policies grant permissions to your bucket and all objects inside it.
4. Batch operations cluster operations into a single API request.
5. Object Locks ensure data integrity; Object Versioning allows rollback to previous states.
6. S3 pricing depends on storage class, requests, data transfer, and usage of advanced features
